//Practice 1

//Convert a user-input into all caps, print the result.

//Input libraries
//Input <toupper>
//Input <iostream>
//Input <iomanip>

//Ask user to type in any letter 

//User would type in any letter or word

//Output "x" or the variable/word the user inputed into all CAPS

//Output errors if user has put anything that isnt A-Z input.



//Practice 2

//Have user input two numbers, add them together and print the result

//Input libraries
//Input <cmath>
//Input <iomanip>
//Input <iostream>

//Ask user for number 1

//Ask user for number 2

//Calculate the total amounts given

//Output the sum of both numbers

//Input error statement if user typed symbols that aren't 0-9



//Practice 3

//Get an unknown amount of numbers from the user and add them together, print out the result.

//Input libraries
//Input <cmath>
//Input <iomanip>
//Input <iostream>

//Create a for loop that holds user input using if and else statements

//Ask user for first number while in the loop

//if user inputs a number, ask user if they want to add more

//if user adds more repeat exact question

//if user says no, end loop and add total all together

//if user uses anything other than 0-9 output error statement and force back into loop



//Practice 4
// Have the user define a maximum whole number, print out a random number between 0 and their number. 
// Allow the user to play again or quit.

//Input libraries 
//Input <cmath>
//Input <iomanip>
//Input <iostream>

//Create a loop with random numbers 

//Ask user for their max number

//Calculate the number line to have the code pick a random varible

//Output random variable

//Ask user to input again

//Input exit statement to escape the loop

//Input error statement if number is lower than 0 or is not a number symbol that is 0-9\



//Practice 5

//Get a random number. If the number is even print “RIGHT”, 
// if it’s odd, print “LEFT”. 
// Do this ten times. Print out how many times it was “LEFT” 
// and how many times it was “RIGHT”.

//Input libraries 
//Input <cmath>
//Input <iomanip>
//Input <iostream>

//Enter range of ten rows

// Allow code to generate or input random numbers

// If the number ends up being even, make sure to have code print out right

// Else have code print out left

//Make sure to determine if number is even or odd using modulus symbol "%" and calculate

//If zero enters the system create "NONE" for its value because it cannot be even or odd. 

// Output how many times even was used and how many times odd was used

//End code
